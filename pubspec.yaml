    # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages
    # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
    # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
    # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
    # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
    # example:
    # fonts:
    # - family: Raleway
    # fonts:
    #  - asset: fonts/Raleway-Regular.ttf
    # - asset: fonts/Raleway-Italic.ttf
    #  style: italic
  #   - family: Trajan Pro
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
